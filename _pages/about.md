Hi! My name is Luofeng Liao (廖烙锋 in Chinese) and I am a 4th year phd student in the IEOR Department of Columbia University.
A bit on pronunciation: Luofeng is like 'law-fung' with a bit of a 'w' sound in 'law', and 'Liao' rhymes with 'meow', like 'Lee-ow'.



My research interests are machine learning methods for causal inference and econometrics, learning and inference in market design, and adversarial optimization. 


Currently, I'm working with Prof. [Christian Kroer](http://www.columbia.edu/~ck2945/) on statistical inference theory for equilibrium in auction markets, a theory that is useful for internet advertising business.
Prior to Columbia, I received my bachelor’s degree in computer science in Fudan University in China and a master's degree in statistics in University of Chicago. In UChicago, I used to work with Prof. [Mladen Kolar](https://mkolar.coffeejunkies.org) and Prof. [Zhaoran Wang](https://zhaoranwang.github.io). In Fudan I was advised by Prof. [Ke Wei](https://makwei.github.io).
